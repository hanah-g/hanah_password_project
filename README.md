# hanah_password_project

This is my python code that allows the user to check the strength of their password, and/or create a password vault for their accounts!

I originally started this project because I took a cybersecurity course that used password breakers such as John the Ripper/Johnny, 
and I wanted to learn more about how they work. From there, I changed the code so that it would instead take user input and check it against the most 
commonly used passwords (taken from Wikipedia) as well as check the strength of the password (length as well as varied character types). 

I then added a way for users to store their account, username, and password with the password being encrypted in the text file. Users have the option to add a new account, or search for a specific account within the list of ones they have stored.

Thank you for checking out my code! :)
