# hanah_password_project

This is my python code that allows the user to check the strength of their password, and create a password manager for their accounts!
I originally started this project because I took a cybersecurity course that used password breakers such as John the Ripper/Johnny, 
and I wanted to learn more about how they work. From there, I changed the code so that it would instead take user input and check it against the most 
commonly used passwords (taken from Wikipedia) as well as check the strength of the password (length as well as varied character types). 
I then added a simple storage solution for passwords/usernames/accounts.


Thank you for checking out my code! :)
